# Future Improvements

This document outlines potential improvements for the observability stack.

## Short-term Improvements

- **Dashboard Standardization**: Create a consistent style and layout across all dashboards
- **Custom Exporters**: Develop exporters for any services lacking metrics
- **Alert Documentation**: Add runbooks for each alert with resolution steps
- **Integration Tests**: Create automated tests for the observability stack

## Medium-term Goals

- **OpenTelemetry Adoption**: Transition from traditional exporters to OpenTelemetry collectors
- **Log Processing Pipeline**: Enhance log processing with structured parsing and metadata extraction
- **SLO Implementation**: Define and track Service Level Objectives for key services
- **Metrics Cardinality Control**: Implement best practices to manage metrics cardinality

## Long-term Vision

- **Distributed Tracing**: Implement end-to-end tracing across all services
- **AIOps Integration**: Leverage AI for anomaly detection and automated remediation
- **Metrics Federation**: Set up metrics federation for multi-cluster observability
- **Cost Analysis**: Track resource usage costs by service and optimize observability resource consumption

## Implementation Priorities

1. Complete any remaining short-term improvements
2. Start incrementally implementing medium-term goals with OpenTelemetry as the first priority
3. Plan for long-term vision items in future quarters
